# DGS-Helper
The Jupyter Notebook used to run DeepGlycanSite and the Dockerfile used to reproduce a functional distribution of DeepGlycanSite. 

Run Instructions can be found in the 'analysis.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook. It is designed to be point-and-shoot. Then, 'graph_dgs.ipynb' was used as post-processing.
